Thank you for the update.

I can now see a total of 7 report constants in the database.
Just to confirm — are these 7 report types mapped across all 16 product variants?

Additionally, could you please confirm how many content-level changes are required in the reports for each respective product variant?
This will help in estimating the effort and proceeding with the correct modifications.
