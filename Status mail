Subject: Current Work Status and Request for Access to Missing Product Variant Applications

Hi Sir,

I would like to share the current status of my work. The development is in progress; however, I am facing an issue with a few product variants.

For some product variants, the application details are not available or I do not have access, due to which I am not able to retrieve the required payload/request data. Without this information, I cannot proceed with the report development and testing for those variants.

I have shared an Excel sheet showing the current working status.
The rows highlighted in yellow indicate the product variants that are not found or not accessible.

Additionally, I have attached a text file with screenshots for your reference.
Request you to please check and arrange access or share the missing payloads/applications, so that I can continue the development without delay.

Thanks & Regards,
Ramkrishna Gaikwad

If you want a shorter or more formal version, I can refine it further.
