Subject: Estimated Timelines for KFS Hindi Report Development

Hi Sir,

As per our discussion, there are 7 reports which are mapped to 16 different product variants. I want to share the detailed timeline for the development work.

I have completed only 1 report so far. The remaining development is still pending.


---

1. Home Loan Project – 4 Reports

All 4 reports require full development of both structure and logic as per each product variant.
For one report, the development involves:

Creating/Updating Stored Procedure

Creating Data Repository

Creating DTO/VO

Home Loan Report Service changes

Home Loan Report Structure changes

Adding new parameters & collections

Around 9 Java files need to be created/updated

3 report structures (JRXML/JRB/JRBC) required

Verification of content as per each product variant


Based on this effort, one report takes approx. 4–7 working days.

So, for 4 reports, the estimated time is 15–20 working days.

2. Home Loan Related Products – 2 Reports

These reports belong to a different project/module.
I have not worked on this module earlier, so I need time to understand:

Report flow

Existing structure

Dependencies

Hindi conversion logic (joint words, parameters, etc.)


Estimated effort:

3–4 days – Analysis of report flow and structure

4–5 days per report for development → 8–10 days


Total for 2 reports → 10–15 working days


---

3. Overall Estimated Timeline

For all Home Loan + Home Loan Related product variants:

Total effort required: 25 to 35 working days

Request

This development involves major changes across multiple modules, report structures, and product variants.
Request you to please consider the above effort and timelines while planning expectations and delivery dates.

Thanks & Regards,
