Subject: Estimated Timelines for KFS Hindi Report Development

Hi Sir,

As per our discussion, there are 7 reports mapped to 16 different product variants. I am sharing the detailed effort and timelines for the required development.

I have completed only one KFS report so far.
Initially, as per our previous discussion, only the standard KFS Home Loan report was required, so I developed that accordingly.

However, as per the updated requirement, the development now needs to be done product-variant wise, and each variant has a different report flow, logic, and structure. Hence, the effort has increased significantly.

1. Home Loan Project – 4 Reports

All 4 reports require full development of both structure and logic as per each product variant.
For one report, the development involves:

Stored Procedure changes/creation

Data Repository

DTO/VO creation or update

Report services and report structure changes

Adding new parameters and collections

Around 9 Java files to be created/updated

3 report structures (JRXML/JRB/JRBC)

Variant-wise content verification


Based on this workload, one report takes approx. 4–7 working days.
So, developing 4 reports will require around 15–20 working days.

2. Home Loan Related Products – 2 Reports

These reports are part of another module.
I have not worked on this module earlier, so first I need to understand:

Report flow

Existing structure and logic

Dependencies

Hindi conversion logic (joint words, parameters, etc.)


Estimated effort:

3–4 days for analysis

4–5 days per report for development → 8–10 days


Total → 10–15 working days

3. Overall Estimated Timeline

For all Home Loan + Home Loan Related product variants:
👉 Total effort required: 25 to 35 working days

Request

This enhancement involves major changes across modules, report structures, and product variants.
Request you to kindly consider the above effort and timelines for planning and expectation alignment.
