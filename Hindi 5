Thank you for the update.

I can now see a total of 7 report constants in the database.
Just to confirm — are these 7 report types mapped across all 16 product variants?

Additionally, could you please confirm:

1. How many content-level changes are required in the KFS reports for each respective product variant?


2. How many changes or impacts are expected in the Agreement reports related to these variants?



This information will help in estimating the development effort accurately.
