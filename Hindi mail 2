Hi [Manager Name],

Thank you for the update.

I would like to highlight that I do not have full clarity about these product variants and how/where each of them is executed or used in the system. To proceed correctly, I will also require the payload/request data for each individual variant, so that I can test and validate the reports accurately.

As per the list, there are 16 variants, and each one requires a separate KFS Hindi report. For every variant, the development involves multiple components, such as:

Updating/creating Stored Procedures

DTO/VO classes

Repository and service logic

Handling sub-reports

Creating or modifying JRXML/JRBC files for the Hindi version


Since each report requires end-to-end development and testing, the overall work is quite extensive. Therefore, completing all 16 variants is not possible within 1–2 days. This will require a realistic amount of development time.

Request you to kindly confirm the timelines or allocate additional support if required.
